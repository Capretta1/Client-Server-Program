# Client-Server-Program
We now show the implementation of a simple client/server program that
uses the socket interface to send messages over a TCP connection. The
program also uses other Unix networking utilities, which we introduce as
we go. Our application allows a user on one machine to type in and send
text to a user on another machine. It is a simplified version of the Unix
talk program, which is similar to the program at the core of an instant
messaging application.
